# File-Handling-and-management
In this program I used File Handling to access any file in the computer directory.
You have to put the file adress in the input . You can use double quotes also if you want, the program is designed to work in both ways.
You can access the file, delete it, modify it, and also create a new one wherever you like in the computer directories.
